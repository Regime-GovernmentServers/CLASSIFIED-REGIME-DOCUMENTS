        <p class="RF">Evening my lovely, lovely, assistant! What's the status on the AI so far?</p>
        <p class="AJ">Oh... G-good evening. Unfortunately, the news you'll be hearing may be disappointing.</p>
        <p class="AJ">A lot of the scripts that have been written here are not optimized for its limited amount of processing power.</p>
        <p class="RF">Hmm, so what you're saying is that we need more servers?</p>
        <p class="RF">Are you mad? We're not ready to lose another couple of thousands for this.</p>
        <p class="AJ">Nonono, that's not what I meant!
        <p class="AJ">Perhaps, I can modify the scripts so that the AI could run stable.</p>
        <p class="RF">Oh. Well apologies for the misunderstanding. It seems you have everything under control, so I shall be off.</p>
        <p class="AJ">But wait! The problem is that it will take me at least 3 months to finish rewriting half of the code!</p>
        <p class="RF">Then if you can't do it, prioritize Project Squid and let the others figure it out!</p>
        <p class="RF">I want to see one decently functioning AI by Q4.</p>
        <p class="RF">And if not, she's gonna have a playdate with lead.</p>
